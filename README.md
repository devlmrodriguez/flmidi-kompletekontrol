# Komplete Kontrol DAW Integration for FL Studio

Implementation of the deep integration mode found on Native Instruments' Komplete Kontrol keyboards for FL Studio.

This script aims to support all the features of this mode, offering the same features found on supported DAWs like Ableton Live or Logic Pro X.

For installation know-how and info on how to use the script, download the HTML manual from the assets of the [latest stable release](https://github.com/hobyst/flmidi-kompletekontrol/releases/latest).

## Main features

- Takes advantage of the DAW integration mode
- Playback control right from the device
- Full mixer support, including peak meters on S-Series MK2 devices

## Compatible devices

### Komplete Kontrol

- [x] Komplete Kontrol A25/49/61

- [x] Komplete Kontrol M32 (works the same way A-Series does)

- [x] Komplete Kontrol S49/61/88 MK2

- [ ] Komplete Kontrol S25/49/61/88 MK1 (incompatible, compatibility might be implemented in the future)

### Maschine

Maschine devices use a different way to communicate with DAWs than how Komplete Kontrol
keyboards do, therefore this script isn't compatible with them.
