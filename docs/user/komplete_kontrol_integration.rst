============================
Komplete Kontrol integration
============================

If an FL Studio project has Komplete Kontrol instances loaded and one of them gets selected in the channel
rack, the instance will be accessible from the keyboard using the PLUG-IN button of the keyboard.

Once the keyboard is in Komplete Kontrol mode, you can switch back to the mixer mode using either the MIXER or
the TRACK button depending on your keyboard.
