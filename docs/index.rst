Welcome to Komplete Kontrol DAW Integration Script for FL Studio's documentation!
=================================================================================

This MIDI script for FL Studio allows the DAW to communicate with Komplete Kontrol keyboards and enable
features otherwise not available such as the mixer controls and the automatic switch between loaded
Komplete Kontrol plugin instances versus to the MCU implementation which only provides basic transport controls
and some buttons don't work as supposed.
